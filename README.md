index.html is the starting page when visited from the web.
README.md is this file. It appears to be a readme file.
Perhaps there should be other files in this project. I envision this being a starting point for learning to work
with Claude Code from Anthropic. I want to learn more about creating apps. I want to work on developing my
writing skills. I would like to practice better organization of my time, my interests, my work, and my life goals.
These sort of things might be interesting concepts for making something of this site and this learning exercise.
Venture forth!
